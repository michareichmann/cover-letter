Dear Hiring Manager,\par
%
Considering my background in particle and detector physics, I'm extremely excited to be applying to the \@position position at \@company.
%As a highly analytical individual, I aim to always make rational and objective observations about the world around me.
With my object orientated programming skills in both python and \cpp and my physics background, I am going to excel at your company.
I'm thrilled to have the opportunity to offer my talents to \@company, which is a leading developer and manufacturer of electromagnetic field detectors and applications.\par
%
While working in my previous role at \@oldcomp, I developed a setup to evaluate future particle detectors for the Large Hadron Collider and other high irradiation environments.
Doing so, I was responsible for several measurement campaigns leading and organising a small team of about five persons.\par
%
While at \@oldcomp, I was able to acquire many new skills and developed myself on a great scale.
Writing software to instrument the measurement devices and to run the data-acquisition, I learned many things about programming in both python and \cpp and understood the advantages of graphical user interfaces.
I set up a complete framework to analyse large amounts of data using multithreading and presented the data in a web application.\par
%
I'm grateful for this opportunity.
I'm looking forward to learning more details about the \@positionshort position and the \@company as a whole.
I'm a committed individual looking to join a goal-oriented team, and I feel that \@company offers me an environment where I can apply my skills on worthy projects.\par
%
Sincerely,\par
